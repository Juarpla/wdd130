            <p> 
                Hello! My name is Juan Plasencia and I am from Lima, Per√∫, a beautiful and diverse 
                country in South America. Coding is my passion and I am always eager to learn new 
                skills and technologies. I have been teaching myself Java and Spring Boot, which 
                are powerful tools for web development. I am also looking for opportunities to work 
                as a software developer, where I can apply my knowledge and creativity. Apart from 
                coding, I have a lot of other interests that make me happy. I love swimming, which 
                is a great way to exercise and relax. I love traveling, which allows me to explore 
                new countries and cultures. I love eating delicious food, which satisfies my taste 
                buds and nourishes my body. I love visiting historical places, which enriches my 
                mind and inspires me. I love taking pictures, which captures the beauty and memories 
                of life. Most of all, I love spending time with my wife and cat, who are my family 
                and my support system. We love to have fun and relax together, enjoying every moment 
                of our lives.
            </p>
